## Features

The appender has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | x | String | The name of the appender. |
| class | x | String | The full name of the class where either the `appendInstance`, if specified, or the `append` is located. |
| append | | String | The name of the method that will be invoked when a message should be logged. The return type should be `void` and should accept 1 `String` parameter. If an `appendInstance` is not specified, this method should be static. If not specified, this will default to `"append"`. |
| appendInstance | | String | The name of the static method that will return the instance where `append` will be invoked. The method should return an object of any type and have no parameters. |
| cacheInstance | | boolean | If `false`, it will reacquire the instance from `appendInstance` every time `append` is invoked. If `appendInstance` is not specified, this has no effect. It defaults to `true`. |

It also has the following elements:
