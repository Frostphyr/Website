## Features

* Adds support for older versions of Log4j2, with the minimum supported version being 2.0.1.
* Adds support for the `ignoreExceptions` attribute. If `false`, exceptions while appending events will be propagated to the caller. If `true`, exceptions will instead be internally logged and then ignored. It defaults to `true`.
