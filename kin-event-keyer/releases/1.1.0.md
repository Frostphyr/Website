---

## Features

* Allows you to select the sheet to use during startup.
* Looks for columns containing the word "Type" instead of "Regular Type" to make using non-regular types easier.

## Bug Fixes

* Now rounds the percentages to the closest integer. For example, the below percentages would be rounded to the following values:
    * 49.4 (0.494) > 49 (0.49)
    * 49.5 (0.495) > 50 (0.5)
    * 49.7 (0.497) > 50 (0.5)
